# Ludum Dare 37 Journal

Random notes about how time was spent during the game jam.

## 2016-12-09

* 12:00pm - Realize LD37 is happening today
* 7:00pm - Decide to check themes even though I wasn't planning to participate
* 8:00pm - Register with new domain and vote in Final Poll anyway, just in case
* 8:30pm - Decide I might join in depending on the themes
* 9:00 - Check theme; "One Room" -> I was kind of thinking of ideas for this One
* 9:05 - Create new git repo on computer and start booting tools to make sure things are installed, updated, etc.
* 9:10 - Brainstorm ideas
* 9:30 - Start journal
* 10:00 - flesh out idea a bit
* 10:30 - Setting up boilerplate
* 11:30 - Realize I never checked an important file into the git repo for my LD35 entry that I was planning to reference; much sadness ensues
